**Junk Cycle** is a turn-based resource management game where you navigate a bike commute through the city with the bike cobbled together from household junk. Your goal is to reach your destination within the turn limit by managing your battery carefully and choosing when to boost versus coast. The game combines the strategic decision-making of deck-builders with the absurd humor of everyday objects repurposed as bike parts (hair dryer engine, fire alarm horn, blender motor).
